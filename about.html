      <p>xSpectre is a startup company developing a handheld spectrometer, or as we regard it - a <i>Swiss army knife for soil sensing</i>. xSpectre was founded in 2020 and is based in Stockholm, Sweden.</p>

      <p>With seed funding from <a href="https://www.vinnova.se/en/">Sweden's innovation agency VINNOVA</a> and <a href="https://agtech2030.com/en/">Agtech2030 - An innovative environment for the agriculture of the future</a> we have developed a solution for on-demand, rapid and cheap soil analysis.
      </p>
      <p> Our overall vision is <b>combining modern soil sensing with a user community enabling local knowledge for solving global problems</b>. Or in more detail: </p>

        <h3 class="lead"id="anchor1"> Supporting farmer livelihood </h3>

        <p>The escalating costs for fuels and fertilizers jeopardise the economy of farmers, herders and ranchers. Widespread loss in soil fertility and soil health threaten not only the economic sustenance of farming but also the ecological foundation of the soil itself. Soils contribute about 5 % of the human caused global warming by losses of soil organic carbon entering the atmosphere as the green house gas carbon dioxide. New approaches and solutions for both economic and ecological sustainability are urgently required. xSpectre's <i>Swiss army knife for soil sensing</i> is a toolset for supporting eco-sustainability in farming, herding and ranching.</p>

        <h3 class="lead"id="anchor2"> Climate impact </h3>

        <p>The climate and soil health effects of regenerative farming are difficult and costly to monitor and verify. Yet it has the potential to reverse the flux of climate gases and turn soils from decaying and releasing green house gases to capturing carbon and improving soil health by increasing the soil organic carbon (SOC) content. The pocket sized soil laboratory developed by xSpectre is an advanced and cost-effective instrument for the monitoring, reporting and verifification (MRV) of soil carbon content and fluxes.</p>

        <h3 class="lead"id="anchor3"> Local knowledge for solving global problems </h3>

        <p>Farmer livelihood and regenerative farming improving soil health while capturing atmospheric carbon dioxide go hand in hand. xSpectre's mission is to support this win-win solution for farmers and climate through soil information acquired with a combination of modern sensing technology, local knowledge and Artificial Intelligence (AI).</p>


        <h3 class="lead"id="anchor4"> Our aims: </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Speeding up and facilitating monitoring and verifying soil conditions,
          </li>
          <li>
            Decreasing the use of energy and fertilisers while maintaining yield,
          </li>
          <li>
            Converting farming from a contributer to a sequester of climate gases,
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved resource management by harvesting local knowledge, and doing it
          </li>
          <li>
            Together with a user community of farmers and ag-tech specialists.
