        <p><em><b>Field probes</b></em></p>

        <p>For direct, in-situ field measurements xSpectre's spectrometer<b>+</b> has a sturdy aviation (GX16) plug that can use direct sensing probes for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>soil temperature,</li>
          <li>soil humidity,</li>
          <li>soil electric conductivity (EC),</li>
          <li>soil salinity, and</li>
          <li>soil Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), or NPK.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The temperature, humidity, EC and salinity probes have a high (scientific) precision while the pH and NPK sensors are more indicative and are better used for relative content within the same soil region. All sensors are built with stainless steel pins that can be pushed into the soil without any further tool requirements.</p>

        <p><em><b>Laboratory Ion Selective Electrodes (ISE)</b></em></p>

        <p>For laboratory soil sensing, xSpectre's spectrometer<b>+</b> is equipped with a standard BNC connection for attaching Ion Selective Electrodes (ISEs). ISE is an analytical technique for determining the activity (concentration) of ions in aqueous solution by measuring relative electrical potential. The primary ions that can be monitored with xSpectre's spectrometer<b>+</b> include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>H<sup>+</sup> (pH),</li>
          <li>NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>,</li>
          <li>NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>,</li>
          <li>K<sup>+</sup>, and</li>
          <li>Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="lead"id="anchor4">Microcontrollers</h3>

        <p>The past decade has seen a very rapid development in microcontrollers, both the hardware and the programming languages. This development has been led by <a href="https://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</a> and the C/C++ dialect they have developed. The de-factor standard that has developed has led to unified protocols and communication norms, allowing the microcontrollers to connect both to mobiles, tablets and computers on the one hand, and to the new generation of sensors listed above on the other.</p>

        <p>xSpectre's spectrometer<b>+</b> uses a microcontroller from Nordic Semiconductor and the Arduino C/C++ dialect for internal control functions, with commands and results sent either via USB-cable of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).</p>
        <hr>

        <h3 class="lead"id="anchor5">Progressive Web App (PWA)</h3>

        <p>The spectrometer+ is operated by a cross-platform application (app) developed with Progressive Web Apps (PWA). In a nutshell PWA is a web-page that appears as an app and can be run on any browser (mobile, tablet or computer).</p>

        <p>Through the app the user controls the spectrometer<b>+</b> and the device that hosts the app (i.e. the mobile) is used as an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) center that links the spectrometer<b>+</b> to xSpectre's backend server solution.</p>

        <p>New developments in cloud services (e.g. Google Could Run) are improving the deployment of many internet solutions, including PWA; the novel services make it easier to administer internet resources, support automation for seamless integration of different services and offer leaner hosting that is charged only when used. xSpectre is hence at present (January 2023) shifting from an older deployment system to using Google Cloud Run.</p>

        <h3 class="lead"id="anchor6">Mathematical-geometric modeling framework</h3>

        <p>One of the innovative parts of xSpectre's solution is the patent pending mathematical-geometric modeling framework. The framework serves two main purposes; the first is to facilitate for domain experts (farmers and ag-tech specialists regarding soil conditions) to construct spectral translation models; the second to graphically present results of spectral scans, including contents, quantities, correlations and uncertainties.</p>

        <p>The Swedish patent application is being finalized as this is written. The international, PCT, application was published 26 July 2022: <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=SE372948068&_fid=WO2022159025">SE2150075 - A method and software product for providing a geometric abundance index of a target feature for spectral data</a>.</p>

        <p>The mathematical-geometric modeling framework predicts soil properties on par with ML models, also because it is a hybrid-method that employs ML for calibration. The primary advantage with the mathematical-geometric modeling framework is thus not the statistical performance as such, but the vast improvement in intelligibility allowing non-AI/ML experts to develop and interpret spectral models.</p>
